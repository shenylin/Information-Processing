    print('''The soul selects her own society,
Then shuts the door;
On her divine majority
Obtrude no more.\n''')

    print('''Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing 
At her low gate;
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
'Upon her mat.\n''')

    print('''I have known her from an ample nation
Choose one;
Then close the valves of her attention
Like stone.\n''')
